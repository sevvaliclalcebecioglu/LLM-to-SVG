# LLM-to-SVG: Generative Text-to-Vector Images

This repository contains a Kaggle Package solution for the "Drawing with LLMs" competition.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to generate SVG images from textual descriptions using a Python model class with a `predict()` method. Each SVG is fully vectorized, scalable, and does not contain rasterized images or external data.

## Features

- Converts text prompts into SVG images.
- Minimal, reproducible Python model.
- Compatible with Kaggle Package submission.
- Optional: Streamlit interface for live SVG generation.
